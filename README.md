# Factory Production Line Design - README

## Overview

This project contains the design specifications for two main production lines within a factory: a cheese cutting line and a peach sorting line. Additionally, it includes a design for a sensor and labeling system referred to as "specola". The detailed descriptions and components required for each production line are outlined in the provided PDF documents.

### Cheese Cutting Line

The cheese cutting production line has three options for cutting mechanisms, each with its unique features and components:

1. **Pressure Dicer:**
   - **Mechanism:** Uses 2 nets and 2 pressurized pistons to push cheese through the nets, cutting it into cubes.
   - **Alignment:** Nets are arranged perpendicularly (90 degrees).
   - **Platform:** Adjustable height to integrate with the conveyor system.
   - **Output:** Fixed-size cubes.

2. **Pressure Cutter:**
   - **Mechanism:** Fall-down cutting edge attached to a piston, with a net opposite the piston that pushes the cheese.
   - **Platform:** Adjustable height to integrate with the conveyor system.
   - **Output:** Varying-sized cubes and slices.

3. **Varying Cutter:**
   - **Mechanism:** Uses two fall-down cutting edges arranged perpendicularly.
   - **Platform:** Adjustable height to integrate with the conveyor system.
   - **Output:** Slices and cubes of any desired size.

**Components Required:**
- Nets
- Cutting blades
- Punching machine
- Platform

### Peach Sorting Line

The peach sorting production line consists of four stations designed to align, detect, sort, and package peaches:

1. **Alignment Station:**
   - Organizes and aligns the production queue.
   - Connected to the conveyor railway via clippers.

2. **Detection Station:**
   - Equipped with a sensory box that checks for defective products.
   - Includes a camera (sensor) and lighting for accurate detection.
   - Adjustable height stands for various dimensions.

3. **Sorting Station:**
   - Uses a solenoid to push defective products away from the production line.
   - Defective products are either placed in a container next to the conveyor or moved to another line for collection.

4. **Packaging Station:**
   - Final station where products are packaged.

### Specola System

The specola system includes a sensor box and a labeling bot, manipulated along a 2 H bar. It utilizes belts, pulleys, and stepper motors to drive the robot along the sliders.

**Components:**
- Sensor box with housing for light and sensors
- Belts and pulleys
- Stepper motors
- Sliders
